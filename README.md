# Word2Vec

## Description

This project aims at measuring syntactic and semantic similarities of words by building the Word2Vec Skipgram architecture in NumPy (Python) 

## Input text

```python
text = """A university (Latin: universitas, 'a whole') is an institution of higher (or tertiary) education and research which awards academic degrees in various academic disciplines. Universities typically offer both undergraduate and postgraduate programs. In the United States, universities must offer graduate degrees; institutions offering only undergraduate degrees are colleges.

The word university is derived from the Latin universitas magistrorum et scholarium, which roughly means "community of teachers and scholars".
"""
```

## Output
```python
predicted_words = ['the', 'university', 'graduate', 'teachers', 'institutions']
```
